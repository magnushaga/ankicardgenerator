For loop: Used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or when you know the number of iterations in advance.\n2. While loop: Used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true, and the number of iterations is not known beforehand."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you exit a loop prematurely in Python?",
      "answer": "To exit a loop prematurely in Python, you can use the 'break' statement. When encountered inside a loop, 'break' immediately terminates the loop and transfers control to the next statement after the loop. This is useful when you want to stop the iteration based on a certain condition before the loop's normal termination. Additionally, you can use the 'continue' statement to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next one."

      "answer": "Time Complexity is an asymptotic analysis that focuses on the growth rate of the algorithm as the input size approaches infinity, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms. Actual runtime, on the other hand, is the real time an algorithm takes to execute on a specific machine with a given input. While Time Complexity provides a theoretical understanding of an algorithm's efficiency, actual runtime can be affected by factors such as hardware, programming language, and implementation details. Time Complexity is useful for comparing algorithms conceptually, while actual runtime is important for practical performance considerations."

      "question": "What is method overriding in Python and why is it useful?",
      "answer": "Method overriding in Python occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. It is useful because it allows a child class to modify or extend the behavior of inherited methods to suit its specific needs. This enables more specialized behavior in derived classes while maintaining a common interface. To override a method, you simply define a method with the same name in the child class."

      "answer": "The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes. In Python, it can be implemented using classes for both the subject and observers. The subject class has methods to attach, detach, and notify observers. Each observer implements an update method. Example:\n\nclass Subject:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._observers = []\n        self._state = None\n\n    def attach(self, observer):\n        self._observers.append(observer)\n\n    def notify(self):\n        for observer in self._observers:\n            observer.update(self._state)\n\nclass Observer:\n    def update(self, state):\n        pass\n\nThis pattern is useful for implementing distributed event handling systems."
